## How the Chatbot "Remembers" Things

The conversation memory system works in several ways:

1. **Topic Tracking**: Identifies the main topic of each question (budget, debt, etc.)
2. **Context Enhancement**: Improves vague follow-up questions by adding context
3. **History Maintenance**: Keeps track of recent questions and responses
4. **Contextual Responses**: Uses conversation history to provide more relevant answers

**Example:**

```
User: "What about the budget?"
Bot: [Provides budget information]

User: "What about debt?"  # Bot knows this is about debt specifically
Bot: [Provides debt information]

User: "Tell me more"      # Bot enhances this with previous context
Enhanced Query: "Tell me more regarding debt"
Bot: [Provides additional debt details]
```

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Local Development

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app_professional.py
```

### Production Deployment

The application is designed to run locally without external API dependencies:

- No OpenAI API required
- Local vector database (ChromaDB)
- Offline embeddings (Sentence Transformers)
- Self-contained Python environment

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Error**: Ensure all dependencies are installed

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Document Not Found**: Verify `financial_policy_document.txt` exists

   ```bash
   ls financial_policy_document.txt
   ```

3. **Streamlit Port Conflict**: Use alternative port
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app_professional.py --server.port 8502
   ```

## Search Strategy

The vector search is designed for optimal retrieval:

1. **Semantic Embeddings**: Uses sentence transformers to understand meaning
2. **Chunk Strategy**: Documents split into 1000-character chunks with 200-character overlap
3. **Metadata Enrichment**: Each chunk tagged with section type, keywords, financial data
4. **Multi-Result Search**: Retrieves top 3 most relevant sections
5. **Source Tracking**: Maintains reference to original document sections

## Customization

### Adding New Document Types:

1. Update `DocumentProcessor._identify_section_type()` for new section types
2. Add new response formatting methods
3. Update keyword lists in `ConversationMemory`

### Modifying Response Format:

- Edit the `_format_*_response()` methods in `FinancialChatbot`
- Customize the response templates for different question types

### Adjusting Search Parameters:

- Modify `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` in `DocumentProcessor`
- Adjust `n_results` in search queries
- Change embedding model in `VectorDatabase`

## Development Notes

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **ChromaDB Choice**: Local, persistent vector database that doesn't require external services
2. **Sentence Transformers**: Lightweight, efficient embeddings that work offline
3. **Chunk Strategy**: Balance between context preservation and search precision
4. **Memory Design**: Simple but effective conversation tracking
5. **Response Formatting**: Topic-specific templates for better user experience

### Future Enhancements:

- [ ] Support for multiple document types
- [ ] Advanced query understanding with NLP
- [ ] Export conversation summaries
- [ ] Integration with external APIs
- [ ] Multilingual support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Memory Issues**: For large documents, consider reducing chunk size
3. **Slow Responses**: ChromaDB creates indexes on first run - subsequent queries are faster
4. **Missing Document**: Ensure `financial_policy_document.txt` is in the same directory

### Performance Tips:

- The first query takes longer as the system builds indexes
- Vector database persists between runs for faster startup
- Use the web interface for better user experience
- Clear conversation history if memory usage becomes high

## Contributing

1. Adding support for more document formats
2. Improving response quality
3. Adding new features like export functionality
4. Enhancing the user interface
